## 📌 Project Overview
This blogging management site was developed as part of a task. The project had to be completed within **6 hours**, and during this time, I had to quickly learn and implement new concepts, as I am still a fresher in the field.

Given the short time frame, I researched and developed a basic layout, gaining valuable experience in backend development and full-stack project workflow. It was my first time working on a project of this type, which presented several challenges, but I successfully built a functional and structured application.

## 💡 Learning Experience
Throughout this project, I encountered various new challenges, particularly in backend development. I aim to refine my skills further and become proficient in handling both frontend and backend operations seamlessly.

## 👤 About Me
I currently have a **strong hold on frontend development** and am prepared for frontend interviews. Additionally, I am actively working on improving my backend development skills to become a well-rounded full-stack developer.
